    <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They are four-legged carnivores with a keen sense of smell and hearing. Dogs come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny Chihuahua to the massive Great Dane. They have a variety of coat colors and textures, from short and sleek to long and curly.</p>
    <p>Dogs are highly social animals and have been bred for centuries to be companions to humans. They are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and playful nature. Dogs can be trained to perform a variety of tasks, including hunting, assisting people with disabilities, and herding livestock.</p>
